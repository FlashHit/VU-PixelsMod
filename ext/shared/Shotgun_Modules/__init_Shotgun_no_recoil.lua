-- This wil hide the messages in the console if set to false
-- information is good, but can also be a bit overkill.

bEnable_announcement = false -- if this is true, the print announcement wil show in the console

-- Also place a end statement below the line you added to close the statement properly and restart the server
-- true is print statement visible
